Atelier Disko Micro Distribution
-- Distribution for Atelier Disko micro projects.

Abstract
--------
This is an application distribution. This distribution is providing a
boilerplate for Atelier Disko projects and contains confidential and
proprietary code.

This distribution especially is made for "micro" projects. Such a project
doesn't have a backend but consists of plain HTML files or some simple PHP
files, CSS and JS.

HTML
----
HTML files are to be placed in `app/webroot/`.

PHP
---
To enable PHP on this project simply rename `app/webroot/index.html` to 
`index.php`. You may also create `app/composer.json` when you plan to
use composer.
