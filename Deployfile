# methods use HOST, USER and PASSWORD (when set) to connect.
# - "ssh+rsync" to transfer files using rsync over ssh
# - "ssh" to use scp
# - "manual" to build the package locally but not transfer it
METHOD="ssh+rsync"

# Will exclude directories and files in transfer tasks. Separate with spaces.
# Possible used with rsync and lftp. fnmatch(5) patterns are allowed. To exclude
# whole directory (not just its contents) DO append slash. Patterns prefixed
# with a slash are anchored at the base path (when used with rsync).
