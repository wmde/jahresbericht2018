# The transfer method to use during deployment. Can be either the follwing. Most
# methods use TARGET_HOST, TARGET_USER and TARGET_PASSWORD (when set) to connect.
# - "ssh+rsync" to transfer files using rsync over ssh
# - "manual" to build the package locally but not transfer it
TRANSFER_METHOD="ssh+rsync"

# Will exclude directories and files in transfer tasks. Separate with spaces.
# Possible used with rsync and lftp. fnmatch(5) patterns are allowed. To exclude
# whole directory (not just its contents) DO append slash. Patterns prefixed
# with a slash are anchored at the base path (when used with rsync).
TRANSFER_IGNORE="/media/ /media_versions/ /log/ /tmp/ /files/"

# Command/s to execute before and after transferring. Commands will be executed by
# TARGET_USER on a target host using TARGET_PATH as the working directory.
PRE_TRANSFER_COMMANDS="mkdir -p log tmp && find tmp log -type f -delete"
