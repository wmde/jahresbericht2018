   You'll need a browser with CSS variables support to make this
   work during development only.

   http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables

   Usually such a browser is needed only during development and
   a build/deploy process will convert the variable syntax for
   browser that don't understand it for all other environments.

   Please note that due to compatiblity CSS variable definition
   are limited to `:root` only.
